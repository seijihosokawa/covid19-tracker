This is a Covid-19 Tracker using React.js and Material-UI.

This was my first project using React and I wanted to create a simple dashboard tracking Covid-19 cases, recoveries and deaths. It allows the user to select any country to see their data on the infoboxes, map and chart. The user can click on one of the info boxes to display cases, recoveries or deaths which will reload the map, table and chart to display the selected value. The map is imported from react-leaflet and has circles depending on the countries severity of cases and can be moved around with mouse and zoomed in/out. An infobox will pop up if the user clicks on the circle.
